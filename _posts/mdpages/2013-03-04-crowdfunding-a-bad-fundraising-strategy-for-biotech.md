title: "Crowdfunding: A Bad Fundraising Strategy for Biotech"
---

[This article](http://www.genengnews.com/bioperspectives/the-risks-and-perils-of-crowdfunding/4760) in GEN suggests that crowdfunding isn't all it's made out to be, at least for biotechnology startups. Here are a few of the main reasons:

<ol><li><b>Regulation is still in flux.</b> Regulations surrounding equity based crowdfunding are still being hammered out and investment-based crowdfunding will still need to go through brokers. Seems like the crowdfunding platform is an extra layer of complexity in this situation.</li><li><b>Low ceiling on funds raised.</b> There's a maximum of $1 million raised per 12-month period. This is completely absurd for most biotechnology projects. You might be able to hire a small group of software developers for a web startup for this amount, but $1 million per year is the burn rate for a medium- to large-sized academic lab consisting of graduate students and postdocs (who make 50-70% of market wages with no loaded labour costs of benefits or pensions).</li><li><b>10-20% of the total amount raised goes to fees. </b>Enough said.</li><li><b>Loss of confidential data. </b>If you need to disseminate information to the crowd to raise funds, it's guaranteed that a competitor will see it. In biotech, competitors with more people, funds, and technology will take a key idea and run with it - way faster than you can.</li></ol>
