title: "OICR: Perhaps One of the Best Canadian Employers Ever"
---

I haven't posted anything in the past several weeks as I've been incredibly busy with a whole series of projects. This is even despite going to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AGBT14" target="_blank">AGBT 2014</a> and seeing the GenapSys presentation ([Wow](http://twitter.com/richardmleggett/status/434496428594167808). Just [wow](http://twitter.com/kennamshaw/status/434495336636510208).).

Today, everyone at OICR received the following email, which must be either the most awesome or most Canadian thing I've ever heard of from anyone, anywhere I've worked before.

Incredible!
