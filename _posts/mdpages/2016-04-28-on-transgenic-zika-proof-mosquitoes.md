title: "On Transgenic Zika-Proof Mosquitoes"

[Reinaldo Jose Lopes](http://www.nature.com/news/why-transgenic-insects-are-still-not-ready-for-prime-time-1.19804):

> Even if [Oxitec's] transgenic mosquitoes can be proven to reduce dengue or Zika infections, it is possible that natural selection could reduce their effectiveness. Females could develop a preference for wild-type A. aegypti males â€” stopping the company's currently furthest-developed lineage of GM insects (called OX513A) from spreading in the wild.

At best this means a lot of money for Oxitec and little value for the payors. At worst, Zika virus adapts and the mosquitoes become useless.
