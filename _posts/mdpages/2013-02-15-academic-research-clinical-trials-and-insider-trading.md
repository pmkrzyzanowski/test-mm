I wrote a short [article for Signals Blog](http://www.signalsblog.ca/high-stakes-unpublished-research-brings-big-profits-and-huge-losses-to-insider-traders/) (a blog led by Canadian Stem Cell Network and the Centre for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine) about recent cases of academic research and insider trading, which has become a topic of serious consideration for research institutions:

> The current bellwether of leaked research information involves Sidney  Gilman, based at the University of Michigan, and Mathew Martoma, a  trader at SAC Capital. They met through the Gerson Lehrman Group, ... one of many ‘expert network’ companies hiring  researchers for as much as $1,000 an hour. In 2008, Gilman passed  information on an Alzheimer’s drug clinical trial involving Bapineuzumab  to Martoma, who was arrested by the FBI in late November 2012.

The magnitude of this particular case is remarkable; US$276 million gained for the hedge fund involved and two careers ended in a spectacular flash.
