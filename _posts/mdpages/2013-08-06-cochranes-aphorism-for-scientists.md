title: "Cochrane's Aphorism for Scientists"
---

I just recently heard Cochrane's Aphorism:

> <span class="st">Before ordering a test, decide what you will do if it  is (1) positive or (2) negative. If both answers are the same, don't  take the test.</span>

<span class="st">The origin is probably from clinical practice, but it seems apt to paraphrase it for scientists' use:</span>

> <span class="st">Before running an experiment, decide what you will do if it  is (1) positive or (2) negative. If both answers are the same, don't do the experiment.</span>

<span class="st">Much time, money, and distress would be saved in any field of research if only every PhD was taught this during their first month of work.</span>
