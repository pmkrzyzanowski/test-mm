Didn't know this:

> The business model at ATCC now reflects the modern reality of the  biological research environment. Academic researchers once freely  contributed cells to ATCC, but now deposits are covered under an  agreement that recognizes the potential commercial success of a microbe  or cell line. Royalties from sales by ATCC are shared with the  depositing academic institution.

How does that affect decisions to share biological tools?
It's also a good way to distribute published lab tools, isn't it? A lot of research papers publish constructs, knockout cells, etc., which need to be stored, potentially forever. Would publishers have a similar model requiring depositing tools to the ATCC?

Does this specifically affect stem cells?

If it was in question, the ATCC maintains that it's not about increasing profits (quote).
