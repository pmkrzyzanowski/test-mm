title: "Creativity is literally in your mind"

Jeffrey Paul Baumgartner at TAXI writes about the [thought processes occurring during creative thinking](http://designtaxi.com/news/355285/Characteristics-Of-Highly-Creative-People)[](http://designtaxi.com/news/355285/Characteristics-Of-Highly-Creative-People):

> The dorsolateral prefrontal region of the brain is responsible  for, among other things, intellectual regulation. It includes the  brainâ€™s censorship bureau; the bit of the brain that prevents us from  saying or doing inappropriate things. It allows us to control impulses  and to choose appropriate courses of behavior according to  circumstances. It seems that in highly creative people, this part of the  brain becomes much less active than normal during the period of  creation. This makes sense. If you can reduce the level of thought  regulation when generating creative work (whether ideas, music,  artwork), then fewer ideas will be filtered out as inappropriate and  more will be developed and shared.

Among other things, the [dorsolateral prefrontal region is also involved in deception](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128284.400-powerful-magnets-hamper-our-ability-to-lie.html). Which, I guess, can fall under the umbrella of "preventing us from saying or doing inappropriate things".
