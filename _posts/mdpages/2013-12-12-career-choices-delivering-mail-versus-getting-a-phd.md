---

Canada's main postal company, [Canada Post](http://www.canadapost.ca/), is currently undergoing a major overhaul because despite being a government regulated monopoly, it's actually losing money. This has little to do with science and is probably not an apples-to-apples comparison, but here's an interesting statistic to consider nonetheless: 

<ul><li><strong></strong>Current [](http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/12/11/andrew-coyne-ending-canada-posts-monopoly-would-benefit-taxpayers-and-consumers/) hired after Feb.1, 2013:<b> $19.14</b></li><li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/canadapostdoc/Home/survey/caps-mitacs_postdoc_report-full_oct22013-final.pdf?attredirects=0&amp;d=1" target="_blank">*Average* wage for a postdoctoral researcher in Canada</a>, who has a PhD and probably 9 to 10 years of post-secondary education: $43,973<b>.</b> At 50 hours per week that's <b>$17.59.</b></li></ul>
I like getting mail, but really?<b> </b>
