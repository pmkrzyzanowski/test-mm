title: "This year's flu is probably peaking"
---

The New York Times reports that the U.S. (and probably Canadian) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/health/us-flu-deaths-reach-epidemic-levels-but-may-be-peaking.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">flu season is past it's peak</a>, even though this year's vaccines have middle ground effectiveness:

> A preliminary study rated this year’s vaccine as 62 percent effective,  even though it is a good match for the most worrisome virus circulating.  That is considered “moderately” effective — the vaccine typically  ranges from 50 percent to 70 percent effective. 


A note to whoever's curious: You can get real-time influenza virus reports from the World Health Organization's [FluNet](http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/updates/summaryreport/en/index.html), which provides links to a huge number of [charts describing flu subtypes detected worldwide](http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/flunet/charts/en/index.html). Have a look, it's an interesting diversion.
