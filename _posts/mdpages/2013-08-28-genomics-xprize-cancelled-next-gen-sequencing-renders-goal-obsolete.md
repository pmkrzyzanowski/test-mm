title: "Genomics XPrize Cancelled: Next Gen Sequencing Renders Goal Obsolete"
---

Peter Diamandis, Chairman of the X Prize Foundation, [explains](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-diamandis/outpaced-by-innovation-ca_b_3795710.html) how industry completely blew the Archon Genomics XPRIZE goal out of the water:

> Back in 2006, we announced the Archon Genomics XPRIZE presented by  Express Scripts, which offered $10 million to the first team that could  rapidly and accurately sequence 100 whole human genomes to a standard  never before achieved at a cost of $10,000 or less per genome.

and: 

>  What we realized is that genome sequencing technology is plummeting  in cost and increasing in speed independent of our competition. Today,  companies can do this for less than $5,000 per genome, in a few days or  less - and are moving quickly towards the goals we set for the prize.

All things considered, it's completely logical to pull the competition as it's no longer competitive and the prize became a potential hand out.

To get a general idea of the rationale behind the decision, look at these two summary figures at the NIH which show how much [the cost of sequencing fell off a cliff](http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/) in 2007, just after the XPRIZE was announced. In 2006, the cost per genome was $10 million and the XPRIZE was justified. Not so in 2013.

So while Diamandis implies that there was a failure in setting the Genomics XPRIZE, I have to disagree. This was simply a case of an unforeseen technology surprising everyone involved. That it forced them to adapt in response isn't a win or a fail, it's the normal course of business.
