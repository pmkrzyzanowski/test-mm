title: "Not all research is a waste..."

...but a lot of it is, up to [85%](http://researchwaste.net/) of the resources on scientific research, according to [the REWARD movement](http://thelancet.com/campaigns/efficiency/introduction-update),

> The vision of the proposed REWARD observatory is to improve the value of the entire biomedical research system through systematic and continuous monitoring of the performance of funders, regulators, academic institutions, journals, and researchers; and to examine the culture of the research system to optimize the use of resources and the value of research. The observatory has three broad objectives: identifying key measurement indices that demonstrate how different players are performing in the research environment; developing information management systems for "real life", "real time" collection of data for monitoring changes in research value across the research spectrum; and preparing critical reflections on the comparative evaluation of data collected for target stakeholders.
