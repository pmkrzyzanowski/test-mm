title: "GraphStream Dynamic Graph Library"
---

If you're into network graphics and data visualization, check out the [GraphStream Project](http://graphstream-project.org/):

> GraphStream is a graph handling Java library that focuses on the dynamics aspects of graphs. Its main focus is on the modeling of dynamic interaction networks of various sizes.

And it has several useful features:

> GraphStream allows to store any kind of data attribute on the graph elements: numbers, strings, or any object. Moreover, in addition, GraphStream provides a way to handle the graph evolution in time. This means handling the way nodes and edges are added and removed, and the way data attributes may appear, disappear and evolve.

Watch the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX5rRF6uxow" target="_blank">demo video</a> for example of how graph data can be animated.
