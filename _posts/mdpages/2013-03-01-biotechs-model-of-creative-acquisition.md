title: "Biotech's Model of Creative Acquisition"
---

Leslie Glick, for GEN [writes](http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/biotech-a-model-of-creative-acquisition/4617/):

> What is almost unique about biotechnology today is that competition  to provide a particular product does not necessarily result in winners  and losers, because the potential marketplace for a wide variety of  biotech solutions is so huge, and both the technology and the underlying  science are advancing at an ever-accelerating pace. ... Today, the ability to raise capital, the inventiveness of a company’s  scientists, and the leadership capabilities of management are more  likely to determine the success or failure of the company, rather than  whether or not some other company develops a similar product first.

It's a very interesting conclusion, in the sense that success of companies, specifically biotech companies, is dependent on people from three different disciplines - finance, science, and management. If one is lacking, the whole triangle collapses. This is in stark contrast to what a die-hard scientist will tell you: Science speaks on its own, which is an incomplete viewpoint at best and delusional at it's worst. 

Glick continues: 

> Around 70 years ago, Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter coined the  term, “creative destruction”. In essence, entrepreneurial innovations  disrupt the status quo. Up-and-coming companies overtake the former  leaders, which then fade away. As I noted in the January 15, 2011, issue  of GEN, “When one considers the vibrant pattern of financings, internal  growth, acquisitions, and yes, closings in the biotech industry, it  clearly fits Schumpeter’s model of creative destruction.”
However, that is not the whole story. While creative destruction  certainly applies to the biotech industry, so does what one might call  creative acquisition. In other words, successful firms do not  necessarily lead to the failures of other firms but rather to their own  acquisition by larger firms. Creative acquisition is a function of the  ever-increasing growth potential of the biotech industry.

The skill-sets at each step of research and development are extremely specialized and unique, and since an idea/invention needs to go through multiple steps to end up profitable, let alone used in the market to help people, development inevitably behaves like relay race instead of an all-versus-all competition.
