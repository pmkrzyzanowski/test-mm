<div class="tr_bq">This story [hit the news wires](http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2013/07/15/cancer-and-chemotherapy-reduce-risk-alzheimer-boston-study-finds/W6odekQ4X5jTDlW9WMRUbP/story.html) after the recent Alzheimer's Association International Conference:</div>

> Researchers at the VA Boston Healthcare System found that most types  of cancer were associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s, which has  no cure. Survivors of liver cancer had the most protection, a 51 percent  reduced risk. Cancers of the pancreas, esophagus, lung, and kidney, as well as  leukemia, also appeared to be “protective,” reducing risk between 22 and  44 percent, according to the study presented at the Alzheimer’s  Association International Conference in Boston.

That certainly sounds like great news, but here's the catch: 

> The study, released just days after publication of a  similar report from Italian researchers, is by far the largest to  establish such a link. Results from the Boston study have not been  published in a medical journal, meaning they have not undergone  independent review by scientists not involved in the research.
