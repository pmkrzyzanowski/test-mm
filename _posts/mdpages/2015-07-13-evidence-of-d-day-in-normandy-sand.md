There's an [intriguing slideshow](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/slide-show-donald-weber-war-sands) at The New Yorker about the work of [Donald Weber](http://donaldweber.com/about/), a photographer represented by a Toronto-based gallery, and [Kevin Robbie](http://www.queensu.ca/physics/robbieresearch/home), a physicist at Queen's University, who have documented evidence of the [D Day landings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings) in 1944:

Perhaps most tellingly, the article reminds us this important fact:

> There are clear traces of the landings still in the sand, including tiny  pieces of shrapnel and nearly perfect spheres of iron and glass,  flash-melted in explosions and quickly hardened again. In some parts of  the Normandy coast, they are the only physical reminders of the war. In  another hundred years, they will likely be gone.
