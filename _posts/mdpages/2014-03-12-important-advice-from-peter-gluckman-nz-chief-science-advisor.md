title: "Important Advice from Peter Gluckman, NZ Chief Science Advisor"
---

Peter Gluckman offer <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/policy-the-art-of-science-advice-to-government-1.14838?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20140313" target="_blank">ten points of advice</a> at Nature for those interested in advising government regarding science policy. Amongst the ten, this one is probably most critical:

> <b>Distinguish science for policy from policy for science.</b> Science  advising is distinct from the role of administering the system of public  funding for science. There is potential for perceived conflict of  interest and consequent loss of influence if the science adviser has  both roles. *There is a risk that the adviser comes to be perceived as a  lobbyist for resources *[Emphasis mine].
