title: "Second Part of Series on Michael West, CEO of BioTime, is up at Signals"

The [second part of my series](http://www.signalsblog.ca/the-many-opportunities-for-products-in-the-stem-cell-field-an-interview-with-michael-west-part-2/) of posts on Michael West, CEO of BioTime, is up at Signals Blog. The first post can be found [here](http://www.signalsblog.ca/the-ever-changing-stem-cell-field-an-interview-with-michael-west/).

In this part, I took a look at BioTime's ever-expanding product line of embryonic progenitor cells, which now total about 200. At first glance, the size of their catalogue surprised me:

It felt counterintuitive to define hundreds of different cell lines when stem cells have the advantage of being pluripotent. Shouldnâ€™t a few dozen cell lines be enough to cover all the major applications of regenerative medicine?

Not so, explained West...
