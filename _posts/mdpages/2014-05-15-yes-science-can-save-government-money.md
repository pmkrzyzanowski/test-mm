title: "Yes, Science Can Save Government Money"

Mark Strauss, at io9, writes this about the [abolished U.S. Office of Technology Assessment](http://io9.com/a-key-reason-why-u-s-politicians-dont-understand-scien-1575132934):

> Last week, Rep. Rush Holt (D-NJ) tried to reopen the agency with minimal funding.

He failed.

The legislation—a proposed amendment  to the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act that would have provided  $2.5 million for the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) —was defeated  in the House by a 248-164 vote, with 217 Republicans opposing and 155  Democrats supporting. 

<div data-textannotation-id="53aca01c62b35eaeb87c26bf9a7c7ca3">It's amazing that $2.5 million can't be spared for objective science advice - by a government. The NIH alone spends *a thousand times that amount* each year. In the absence of a strong pro-science lobby group, similar to what[Franklin's List](http://www.checkmatescientist.net/2014/01/franklins-list-helping-scientists.html) is trying to become, an OTA is a much needed government service.</div><div data-textannotation-id="53aca01c62b35eaeb87c26bf9a7c7ca3">
</div><div data-textannotation-id="53aca01c62b35eaeb87c26bf9a7c7ca3">Maybe the OTA was disbanded because it didn't offer good value for money. If only the benefits of something as intangible as *science* could be accounted for:</div>
> <div data-textannotation-id="53aca01c62b35eaeb87c26bf9a7c7ca3">OTA had always saved taxpayers far more money than it cost. An OTA study  on Agent Orange, for instance, helped save the government $10 million.  Another report recommended changes in computer systems at the Social  Security Administration that saved more than $350 million.</div>

<div data-textannotation-id="53aca01c62b35eaeb87c26bf9a7c7ca3">OK, maybe they can. All governments should take notice.</div><div data-textannotation-id="53aca01c62b35eaeb87c26bf9a7c7ca3">
</div><div data-textannotation-id="53aca01c62b35eaeb87c26bf9a7c7ca3">The rationale for dissolving a office like the OTA was even more perplexing when you consider how Newt Gingrich suggested he could compensate for the lack of one:</div>
> <div data-textannotation-id="53aca01c62b35eaeb87c26bf9a7c7ca3">"Gingrich's view was always, 'I'll set up one-on-one interactions  between members of Congress and key members of the scientific  community,'" recalls Bob Palmer, former Democratic staff director of the  House Committee on Science. "Which I thought was completely bizarre. I  mean, who comes up with these people, and who decides they're experts,  and what member of Congress really wants to do that?"</div>

<div data-textannotation-id="53aca01c62b35eaeb87c26bf9a7c7ca3">That's a lot of running around chasing busy members of the scientific community. I'd say that would cost more than $2.5 million worth of politician's time alone, never mind the additional burden and cost of all the meetings stemming from that. If you don't pay for an office like the OTA, the costs are just spread around like a giant game of [hide the umbrella](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/22/how-hospital-administrators-hide-the-umbrella.html). Either way, taxpayers pay.</div><div data-textannotation-id="53aca01c62b35eaeb87c26bf9a7c7ca3">
