> Under the program, investor who seeks to start a fresh business get Canadian PR, and it targets to lure innovative businessmen and connect them with the private sector businesses of Canada via government approved angel investor groups. Business incubators or venture capital funds who would act as the facilitators for establishing the startup business in Canada.

I just finished reading *<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1553654064/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1553654064&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=checkmatescientist-20&amp;linkId=CECIEMJQDHREAFNF" target="_blank">Why Mexicans Don't Drink Molson</a>*, by Andrea Mandel-Campbell, which left me with the impression that this program is also going to need to pair these new businesspeople with Canadian business with the right mindset.
