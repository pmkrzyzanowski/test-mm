Greg Satell, at Forbes, argues that [a mix of computer driven predictions and human intuition](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2014/10/12/the-future-of-marketing-combines-big-data-with-human-intuition/) will drive the future of marketing:

> Yet as powerful as they have become, computers are not all powerful, they perform much better when guided by humans. For example, in a freestyle chess tournament combining both humans and machines, the winner was not a chess master or a supercomputer, but two amateurs running three simple programs in parallel.


> And thatâ€™s gives us a clue to where marketing is going. 

With algorithm driven decision systems like [IBM's Watson](http://mobile.eweek.com/database/ibm-watson-delves-even-deeper-into-data.html) starting to guide medical decisions, I don't think it'll be long before research questions are computer guided as well. People will still need to wade through potential ideas, but arguments that research and development are a purely human-driven enterprise don't seem likely to hang around much longer.

What's wrong with using technology to help you fulfill a job?
