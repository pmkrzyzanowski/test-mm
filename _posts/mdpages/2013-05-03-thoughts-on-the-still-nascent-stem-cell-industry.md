title: "Thoughts on the Still Nascent Stem Cell Industry"

The Life Sciences Report, at Seeking Alpha, [interviewed](http://seekingalpha.com/article/1349371-what-will-it-take-for-stem-cell-companies-to-close-the-valuation-gap) Geoff McKay, of Organogenesis on his thoughts about the regenerative medicine industry, who had this to say:

> It wasn't long ago that pharma was taking a watch-and-wait mentality [with the regenerative medicine industry]. The pharma companies were sending midlevel business development and licensing people to regenerative medicine meetings to assess the assets. Eventually that translated into investments. Today, companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Shire, Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Roche Holding AG (RHHBY.OB), Smith &amp; Nephew, GE Healthcare unit of General Electric (GE), Sanofi SA (SNY) with its Genzyme unit and Astellas Pharma Inc. (ALPMF.PK) have all made notable, tangible investments in the field.



> We are at the beginning. It is not a free-for-all, but there are trends toward an increased number of pharma companies that are committed. We are also seeing an increased number of phase 2 trials that will eventually translate into phase 3 trials.
