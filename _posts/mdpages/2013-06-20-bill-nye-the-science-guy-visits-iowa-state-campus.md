title: "Bill Nye the Science Guy Visits Iowa State Campus"

John Schwartz at The New York Times wrote [a short backgrounder on Bill Nye the Science Guy](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/science/bill-nye-firebrand-for-science-is-a-big-man-on-campus.html), based on Nye's recent visit to Iowa State.

Besides describing Nye's brief work at Boeing (I didn't know about that), Schwartz quotes Nye's brilliant rebuttal against Creationist parents:

> “If you want to deny evolution and live in your world — in your world  that’s completely inconsistent with everything we observe in the  universe — that’s fine. But don’t make your kids do it, because we need  them. We need scientifically literate voters and taxpayers for the  future.”

And I'd add that we need more scientifically literate legislators and politicians, too.
