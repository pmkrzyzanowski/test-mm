title: "Statistics is not Mathematics"
---

[Rafael Irrizarry posted a thoughtful argument](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/01/11/nsf-should-understand-that-statistics-in-not-mathematics/) on why work focused on Statistics should live within it's own department, separate from a Division of Mathematical Sciences in the National Science Foundation, where Statistics currently falls under. 

> Statistics is analogous to otherdisciplines that use mathematics as a  fundamental language, likePhysics, Engineering, and Computer Science.  But like thosedisciplines, Statistics contributes separate and  fundamental scientificknowledge.While the field of applied mathematics  tries to explain the world withdeterministic equations, Statistics  takes a dramatically differentapproach. In highly complex systems, such  as the weather,Mathematicians battle LaPlaceâ€™s demon  and struggle to explain natureusing mathematics derived from first  principles. Statisticians accept that deterministic approaches are not  always useful and insteaddevelop and rely on random models. These two  approaches are bothimportant as demonstrated by the improvements  inmeteorologicalpredictions achieved once data-driven statistical  models were used to complimentdeterministic mathematical models.

Given the huge importance of statistics in genome sciences and other big data sciences, new tools need to be created by statisticians wholly dedicated to solving problems created by new technologies in the biosciences.
