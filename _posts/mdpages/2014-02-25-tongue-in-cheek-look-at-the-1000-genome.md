title: "Tongue in Cheek Look at the $1000 Genome"
---

[This post](http://www.allseq.com/blog/1000-genome-72m) at AllSeq has a list of seven important things to consider if you want to deliver $1000 genomes using Illumina's HiSeq X platform, most of which can be realistically met (for a megaproject), except for these two points:

> <ul><li><strong>You don’t need to pay for the building you’re in and you can work in the dark</strong>. The budget doesn’t include overhead.</li><li><strong>You don’t really want to analyze or store the data.</strong> The $1000 might get you a basic alignment, but nothing else.</li></ul>

Besides overhead, analysis of data has become, and probably will remain for the foreseeable future, the more expensive part of doing genomics.
