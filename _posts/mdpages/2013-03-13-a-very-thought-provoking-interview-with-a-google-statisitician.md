title: "A Very Thought Provoking Interview with a Google Statisitician"
---

From [an interview with Nick Chamandy](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/02/15/interview-with-nick-chamandy-statistician-at-google/), via Simply Statistics:

> Grad school teaches us to spend weeks thinking about a problem and  coming up with an elegant or novel methodology to solve it (sometimes  without even looking at data). This process certainly has its place, but  in some contexts a better outcome is to produce an unsophisticated but  useful and data-driven answer, and then refine it further as needed.  Sometimes the simple answer provides 80% of the benefit, and there is no  reason to deprive the consumers of your method this short-term win  while you optimize for the remaining 20%. 

I wish more people doing academic research thought this way. Striving for perfection is a habit that dies very hard.
