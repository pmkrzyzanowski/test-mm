title: "What to do with a science PHD?"
---

Labguru sent a newsletter today, containing [an overview of career possibilities for science PhDs](http://blog.labguru.com/5-alternatives-to-doing-a-post-doc). I had no idea the numbers changed so dramatically over the last forty years:

> “in 1973, 55 percent of PhD recipients had tenure-track positions within six years of earning their PhDs. In 2006, merely <strong>15 percent</strong> of recent graduates found themselves in this position.”

Whether the cause of this is employer driven '[academic inflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_inflation)' or research driven reliance on 'graduate student and postdoc labor for publications and output', as Labguru suggests, is a matter for another day of finger pointing. For now, Labguru's intended audience seems strange to me:

> If you are reading this while you’re on your second, third or even fourth postdoc, you’re not alone, and are far from the minority.

I don't think I know *anyone* that's on a fourth postdoc. If there are readers on their fourth postdoc, please tell me your story, regardless of whether it's good or bad!
