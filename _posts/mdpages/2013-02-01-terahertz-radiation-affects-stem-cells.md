title: "Terahertz radiation affects stem cells?"
---

Alexandrov et al. in Nature Scientific Reports show how terahertz radiation can affect mesenchymal stem cells and change the expression of genes:

> Our microarray survey and RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that prolonged  broadband THz irradiation drives mMSCs toward differentiation, while  2-hour irradiation (regardless of THz sources) affects genes  transcriptionally active in pluripotent stem cells.

Besides being a very weird (but cool) observation, I imagine that this would lead to the ability to specifically change gene activities using radio frequency devices in some cases and avoid pharmaceuticals. That would be very, very cool indeed.
