title: "Learning to Start Businesses, in the Ivory Tower?"
---

Over at Entrepreneur, Isaiah Hankel wrote what's, overall, [just another article criticizing academic culture](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234315), but if you read it with an open mind you'll find a paragraph that's probably *the* most optimistic description I've ever read of what a research community can pull off, especially since Hankel's describing the academic community: 

> The ivory tower shouldn’t be perceived as a safe haven or a place for  professionals to bide their time when the economy goes south. Rather *it  should be considered the best place to learn how to start and run a  business *[emphasis mine]. Academia’s sole purpose should be developing people not to  just be professors, doctors and lawyers but ones who innovate and invent  products and services.

Agreed, 100%.
