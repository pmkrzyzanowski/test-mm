title: "Checkmate Scientist is Closing Comments"
---

Regular readers (there are about 200) may be sad to find out that I'll be closing comments going forward.

I've become much more busy over the last six months (as you may have noticed by the decrease in posts) and I've unfortunately been moderating an increasing amount of comments that are clearly from spammers. I'd rather spend time reading and writing than deleting spam, and I think you'll agree.

As always, you can send in comments to [comments@checkmatescientist.net](mailto:comments@checkmatescientist.net) or via Twitter to [@pmkrzyzanowski](https://twitter.com/pmkrzyzanowski) and I'll do my best to respond.
