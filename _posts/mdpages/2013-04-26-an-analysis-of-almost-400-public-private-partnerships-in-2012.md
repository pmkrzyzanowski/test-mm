title: "An Analysis of Almost 400 Public Private Partnerships in 2012"
---

Brady Huggett provides a quick overview of partnerships established between [academia and industry](http://www.nature.com/bioent/2013/130401/full/bioe.2013.5.html) in 2012 at Bioentrepreneur:

> Harvard University and the University of Texas system top the list of  universities with the most industry deals, and University College London  lands ahead of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge.

A few observations:

Until now, I wasn't aware that the University of Texas was such a big place of support for industrial partnerships. No big Canadian collaborations made it into the tables.

Secondly, the type of collaborations are dominated by the cancer and infectious diseases fields. Unfortunately, only 4% of the activity was in gene and cell therapy (My friends at [Signals Blog](http://www.signalsblog.ca/) will be disappointed!).

Finally, some of the bigger announcements from the past year are mentioned, namely the [CureBeta Initiative](http://www.evotec.com/article/en/Press-releases/CureBeta-a-collaboration-between-Evotec-and-Harvard-University-enters-strategic-alliance-with-Janssen-Pharmaceuticals/2298) translating [betatrophin](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/04/potential-diabetes-breakthrough/) as a possible treatment for diabetes and the Fluidigm/Broad collaboration to establish a [Single-Cell Genomics Center](http://www.fluidigm.com/may82012.html).
