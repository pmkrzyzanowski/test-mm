title: "Mobility of People"
---

Mobility of peopleis a tricky concept to think about. Let's look at mobility from the eye of a recent PhD student with whom I had a coffee chat.

Me: "So, you must be relieved that you're *finally*done your PhD. What's next for you?"

New PhD: "Well, I'm not ready to look for a job so I'm looking at doing a postdoc, possibly in the States."

I think to myself that a postdoc actually*is *a job, though one advertised as an educational position.

Me: "Cool, where do you think you'll go?"

New PhD: "I don't want to move too far from here [Ontario], so I'm thinking of going to Boston, or New York. I haven't decided."

Me: "Are you leaning either way?"

New PhD: "Well, both cities have people I'd like to work with and all of the labs I'm considering joining have lots of funding so I won't have trouble doing work. But honestly, I'd be making the same amount in salary as I did in Toronto and have to spend almost twice as much in living costs. Financially, it doesn't make sense, but my boss thinks it would be good for my career."

When scientists talk about the inability to attract talent or of brain drains you need to think about what motivations are behind these comments. There are many levers behind changes in the 'mobility of people', especially in scientific disciplines. However, the main drivers behind scientifically savvy people are pull factors that attract them to another location to do their work. 

Let's look at a few in detail.
<h3>Pull Factors</h3><div>There are many reasons that influence people to move to a new location for a job. While those in the research industry are human and respond to all factors that affect human migration, such as climate, war, crime, and so on, most of the time migration happens for socioeconomic reasons. Questions

Or is it just that scientists are going to other countries where research money is relatively more plentiful?
Is it because government policies are making it harder for any non-citizens to take jobs?</div>


...Or are student visas more difficult to come by?
