Turna Ray, at GenomeWeb, reports on [this unfortunate piece of news](http://www.genomeweb.com//node/1287501):


> The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services maintained that the  algorithm portion of Multi-Analyte Algorithm-based Assays (MAAAs) doesn't fit  within its definition of a diagnostic test, and therefore the agency  will not factor it in to pricing.

Here's why this is ridiculous: 


> Although MAAAs currently comprise a very small subset of the MDx market,  many healthcare industry experts predict that these types of  algorithm-based multi-analyte tests will dominate the space in the  future as scientific advances identify hundreds of gene markers  associated with a complex illness and with patients' ability to respond  to treatments.

What this is basically saying that despite algorithm-based assays showing clear value in the medical system, they're not worth anything when it comes to paying for a test?
