title: "Buoys Become Self-Powered Using The Least Likely Part To Generate Power"
---

Scientific American has a short note about <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=patent-granted-for-buoy-generates-power" target="_blank">a patent granted for power-generating buoys</a>:

> Patent no. 8,274,167 describes a buoy that generates its own power. The  floating section of the buoy is connected to a long cable anchored to  the ocean floor or a weight. The cable has a core made of piezoelectric  lead zirconate titanate, a chemical compound first synthesized at the  Tokyo Institute of Technology. As currents flow around the cable,  microeddies move it like the “strumming of a guitar string,” Hughes  says. The power generated depends on the cable's length and tension, but  it theoretically could be enough to power a sonar array.

A very nice example of thinking outside the box and putting the most important piece of technology (the power generating component) into the part that's most likely an afterthought: the cable keeping the buoy in place.
