title: "Science Goes Bigger"

Jim Al-Khalili, at The New York Times, [says](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/opinion/where-science-is-going.html):

> A major  development is likely to be the continuing rise of international  scientific collaborations. They are already bigger and more  international than ever. From the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change to the mapping of the human genome, from the  International Space Station to the discovery of the Higgs boson at the  Large Hadron Collider, it seems nothing can stand in the way of such  glittering scientific juggernauts. Indeed, many of these projects have  become so grand and costly that no one nation can shoulder the entire  burden of running them. 


> <div data-key="AssAss" data-num="6" itemprop="articleBody">Are such scientific research projects destined to get ever bigger and  more costly? And are they likely to become ever more remote and beyond  the control of the average taxpayer and voter?        </div>

<div class="emActive emReady" data-key="IasTiw" data-num="7" data-sentences="2" itemprop="articleBody"><span data-num="1">Well, it depends on how you define a single "scientific research project". Take for instance, the cancer sequencing efforts of [The Cancer Genome Atlas](http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) or the [International Cancer Genomics Consortium](http://icgc.org/icgc), which are really huge projects along the lines of attention grabbing physics experiments like those at [CERN](http://home.web.cern.ch/about), just not all in one place. The ICGC, for example, has 66 projects amongst 15 member countries, so despite being a single project, it's really a coordination of research (and expenses) from many contributors.</span></div><div class="emActive emReady" data-key="IasTiw" data-num="7" data-sentences="2" itemprop="articleBody"><span data-num="1">

<div class="emActive emReady" data-key="IasTiw" data-num="7" data-sentences="2" itemprop="articleBody">It is also vital that scientists communicate their work to people that support it, be they politicians, policy makers, donors to a university or foundation, or the general public.</div><div class="emActive emReady" data-key="IasTiw" data-num="7" data-sentences="2" itemprop="articleBody">
</div><div class="emActive emReady" data-key="IasTiw" data-num="7" data-sentences="2" itemprop="articleBody">Public outreach is probably the most important work, since it's the public that can decide to donate or tell funders (like politicians) that science is important. But outreach is work, and it's work often overlooked when more pressing issues (research, grants, publications) get in the way. Nevertheless, some scientists like [Michael Eisen](http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/) and [Steven Salzburg](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/) still manage to do it, and do it well.</div>
