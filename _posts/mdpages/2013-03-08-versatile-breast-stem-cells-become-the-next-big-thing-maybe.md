The ePS cells, she said, have different expressions, surface  markers and other characteristics than those found with embryonic stem  cells.

The cells sound interesting, probably ethical, but a lot of work is needed to determine what the cells are useful for. The abstract of [the paper itself](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/02/27/1218682110.abstract) doesn't scream that the cells are going to bring a new era of stem cell research, so generating hype risks alienating the public from research that inevitably fails to meet expectations.

But are ePS cells something to keep an eye on? Definitely.
