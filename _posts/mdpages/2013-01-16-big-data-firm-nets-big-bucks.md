Ayasdi, a company that developed a suite of network based analysis and visualization tools, has [netted a big investment](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/jan/16/big-data-firm-topological-data-analysis), writes Guardian:

> A US big data  firm is set to establish algebraic topology as the gold standard of  data science with the launch of the world's leading topological data  analysis (TDA) platform.
[Ayasdi](http://www.ayasdi.com/), whose co-founders include renowned mathematics professor Gunnar Carlsson, launched today in Palo Alto, California, having secured $10.25m from investors including Khosla Ventures in the first round of funding.

The article cites health care, and specifically cancer research, as the primary beneficiary of topological data analysis, otherwise commonly known as [network analysis](http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sigtrans;4/190/tr5) in biological circles. Plenty of resources like [Reactome](http://www.reactome.org/ReactomeGWT/entrypoint.html), <span id="goog_2147432352"></span>[Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/), [GeneMANIA](http://www.genemania.org/) are well known to researchers interested in biological networks.

Among other things, network based approaches have also been used to [redefine basketball player positions](http://flowingdata.com/2012/03/21/redefining-nba-basketball-positions/) and move the number of player types from five to thirteen. There's a good video from the Sloan Sports Conference on the approach <a href="http://www.sloansportsconference.com/?p=5431">here</a>.
