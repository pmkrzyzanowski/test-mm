title: "Nature Genetics on postdoc career development"

Here's a very interesting <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n2/full/ng.2544.html?WT.ec_id=NG-201302">Nature Genetics editorial</a> on developments in postdoctoral fellow training:

> We offer a draft community standard for a postdoctoral career workshop that can be used as a template and resource for career development at any institution. This document addresses the issue of what can be standardized to improve the lot of postdoctoral researchers, given that this is a professional group with diverse objectives that is motivated mainly by scientific curiosity.

The rest of the content describes many areas that postdoctoral training can be improved, but it's nice to see that things are improving, albeit slowly.
