title: "Amazon as an example of the havoc caused by unbridled competition"

Matthew Iglesias at Slate comments on Amazon's drop in Q4 profit:

> It's a truly remarkable American success story. But if you own a  competing firm, you should be terrified. Competition is always scary,  but competition against a juggernaut that seems to have permission from  its shareholders to not turn any profits is really frightening.

This quote can be applied to so many contexts I think it's thoroughly amazing. Generalizing: competition is good, but competition against any company (or anyone) that doesn't have an eye on their bottom line can be terrifying. In this case, you either drive the competition from the market or you pack your bags and leave - waiting it out just places you in a [war of attrition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attrition_warfare).
