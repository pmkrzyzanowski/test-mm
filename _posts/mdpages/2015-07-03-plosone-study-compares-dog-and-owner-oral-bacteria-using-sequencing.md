title: "PLOSOne study compares dog and owner oral bacteria using sequencing"
---

Here's today's weird, but relevant, science paper which comes from a PLOS One <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131468" target="_blank">study</a>. The authors asked whether dogs and their owners shared any oral microbiota. Thankfully the answer is "probably not":

> The results of the present study suggest that bacterial dissemination  between dogs and human is uncommon. ...Few  bacteria from the canine oral microbiome were found in the owners’ oral  samples. The number of [species] identified in both dogs and humans (4.9%,  12/246), was much lower than that in [a] previous study.  Furthermore, among these shared [species], only four seemed to have  disseminated from dogs to humans

That's great news, but the question that immediately came to mind was that this study needed to test more canine-owner pairs than just ten. I trust this paper after learning the following today:

> It is difficult for canine oral bacteria to survive and colonize the  human oral environment because of the physiological differences between  the two environments. First, dog saliva is less acidic (pH 8.5–8.65)  than that of human saliva (pH 6.5–7.5). Because the oral microbiome is altered by pH,  most bacteria in the dog oral cavity may not survive well in the human  oral environment.

Good to know, in case a dog actually kisses me.

Lastly, there's the tooth brushing argument: 

> Second, most humans brush their teeth every day (I assume this is true).  During tooth brushing, most of the supra-gingival bacteria are removed  and are then regenerated. Since dogs teeth are typically brushed less  frequently than those of humans (I also assume this is true), they usually have a mature biofilm that  is substantially different from the immature human oral microbiome.  When canine oral bacteria are transmitted to the human oral cavity, they  have to compete with human oral microbiome constituents and are removed  by frequent tooth brushing.

I don't own a dog, but I'm now aware that a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;fst=as%3Aoff&amp;keywords=dog%20toothbrush&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1435937696&amp;rh=n%3A2975379011%2Ck%3Adog%20toothbrush&amp;rnid=2941120011&amp;tag=thechecscie0c-20&amp;linkId=LWVXQW224EDSI2E6" target="_blank">whole slew of dog dental care products</a> exists on the market!
