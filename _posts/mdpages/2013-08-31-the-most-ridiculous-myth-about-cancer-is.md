title: "The Most Ridiculous Myth About Cancer Is..."

[David Robert Grimes](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/30/six-stubborn-myths-cancer), at The Guardian:

> "Sharks don't get cancer!" is a factoid that has burnt its way into  the public consciousness to such an extent that nothing short of a  cultural lobotomy can erase it. The perceived immunity of this predator  to cancer has led to its slaughter in order to harvest its allegedly  curative cartilage; not only is this no good for sharks, it's no good for humans either. 


> Sharks do get cancer â€“ indeed, pretty much all complex multicellular organisms do, from dogs to elephants.

I've never heard this one and wish I never had. Sure, it's possible to pass off the phrase as a hypothesis, but a simple search of PubMed unearths examples of sharks getting [melanoma](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21370659), [liver and testicular cancer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12962210), as well as [reports of many more](http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps1609/www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/2000/400_upd.html) in the Registry of Tumors in Lower Animals.

Being naive to this rumor, I originally thought it was related to the current media frenzy around "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DCLTA6Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DCLTA6Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thechecscie0c-20" target="_blank">*Sharknado*</a>", but no, the shark-cartilage/liver-oil-panacea meme has been floating around for over twenty years.

Here's a more comprehensive article at the Journal of the National Cancer Institute about [the issues surrounding shark cartilage](http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/97/21/1562.long), its use as an anti-cancer agent in clinical trials, and the companies that sell dietary supplements fabricated from shark tissues. Even then (in 2005), it didn't seem like shark cartilage had a fighting chance against data it wasn't really useful in a clinical setting.
