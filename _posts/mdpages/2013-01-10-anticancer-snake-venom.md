[Snake venom contains tons of useful molecules](http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21569015-snake-venom-being-used-cure-rather-kill-toxic-medicine) that can be used to fight cancer, explains The Economist. The first example goes over eristostatin, derived from the Asian sand viper, nature has evolved as an anti-coagulant:

> Eristostatin’s day job is to stop victims’ blood clotting and thus  plugging up damaged blood vessels after a bite. By increasing blood  loss, it weakens victims. The molecule does this by glomming onto  cellular fragments called platelets that are crucial to the process of  clotting, thus disabling them. Dr Hailey hopes to make use of this  tendency to encourage the immune system to attack melanoma cells. His  idea requires eristostatin to be as attracted to cancer cells as it is  to platelets.

Eristostatin goes one further and attracts T-lymphocytes, immune system cells that attack cells they're targeted to. <strike>Hacking</strike> Harnessing the immune system to fight cancer is a clever idea, and one that's been [bounced around before](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3238317/).
