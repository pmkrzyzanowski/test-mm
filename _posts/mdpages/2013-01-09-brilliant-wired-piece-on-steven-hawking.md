Helene Mialet [writes about Steven Hawking](http://On the occasion of Steven Hawking's birthday, ) in Wired. It was his birthday yesterday. She writes:

> Today, January 8, is Hawking’s [birthday](http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2013/01/happy-71st-birthday-stephen-hawking/), yet on this day it’s worth examining just who and what we are really celebrating: the man, the mind or … the machines?
To understand Hawking, you [have] to understand the people and the machines  without whom he would be unable to act and think; you [have] to understand  the ways in which these entities augment and amplify Hawking’s  competencies. For example: The specialties of his students, which are  spread across very different research fields, enable him to integrate  diverse information and the different facets of a problem in a way that  others cannot. His secretary provides him with a mental assistant many  of us would never have, by sorting and arranging his data according to  his interests and what he is able to process.
