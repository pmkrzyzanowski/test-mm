title: "Data-driven scientists are lazy"

Ouch. [So says petrkiel at R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/data-driven-science-is-a-failure-of-imagination/) as a commentary to Hans Rosling in the BBC's [Joy of Stats](http://www.gapminder.org/videos/the-joy-of-stats/). Maybe not as concisely as 'lazy', but 'failure of imagination' when one is expected to be imaginative is pretty damn close:


> Data-driven scientists (*data miners*) ... believe  that data can tell a story, that observation equals information, that  the best way towards scientific progress is to collect data, visualize  them and *analyze* them (data miners are not specific about what  analyzemeans exactly). When you listen to Rosling carefully he  sometimes makes data equivalent to statistics: a scientist *collects statistics*. He also claims that “*if we can uncover the patterns in the data then we can understand*“. I know this attitude: there are massive initiatives to *mobilize data*, *integrate data*, there are methods for *data assimilation*and *data mining*, and there is an enormous field of scientific<i style="line-height: 16px;"> data visualization*. Data-driven scientists sometimes call themselves *informaticians*or *[data scientists](http://www.r-bloggers.com/software-engineers-guide-to-getting-started-with-data-science/)*. And they are all excited about big data: the larger is the number of observations (N) the better. 

And the punchline:

> Emphasisizing data at the expense of hypothesis means that we ignore the  actual thinking and we end up with trivial or arbitrary statements,  spurious relationships emerging by chance, maybe even with plenty of  publications, but with no real understanding. This is the ultimate and  unfortunate fate of all data miners. I shall note that the opposite is  similarly dangerous: Putting emphasis on hypotheses (the extreme case  ofhypothesis-driven science) can lead to a lunatic abstractions disconnected from what we observe. Good science keeps in mind *both* the empirical observations (data) and theory (hypotheses, models).
