title: "Remembering to Forget"
---

From time to time, we all set aside creative projects that can't be finished in one go. It might be planning or doing something at work like drafting a paper or designing experimental strategies, to one of many personal projects like finding a neighborhood in which to live or simply deciding on a furniture layout.

There comes a time where one becomes fixed on details that aren't important, and the problem exists for it's own sake.

When this happens, the project needs to be set aside for a day, a week, or a month so you can forget the unimportant stuff an return with a fresh mind. In part, that's what a weekend is for. Every so often, details that were all encompassing on Friday yield to a solution on Monday morning.

Remember that some things are best forgotten.
