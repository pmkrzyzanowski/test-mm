title: "Stunning Protein Animations by Nanobotmodels Studio"

Yuriy Svidinenko, head of [Nanobotmodels](http://www.nanobotmodels.com/), is running a crowdfunding campaign to produce more jaw-dropping animations like this one of nanoparticles delivering drugs to cancer cells:

 He's proposing to use the crowdfunding proceeds to produce an animated video about cancer biology and proteins involved in the process, and his IndieGoGo pitch video can be seen below.

You have to wait to see the cool renderings of human IgG at 1:00, what appears to be a protein encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle at 1:12, and a translucent cell (a neuron?) starting at 1:38.

Apparently rendering costs are a significant fraction of making these videos (~40%), which he estimates at about $65-85 *per second*. [The campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/how-cancer-develops-detailed-animation#!) runs until February 25th, 2014.

Best of luck Yuriy!
