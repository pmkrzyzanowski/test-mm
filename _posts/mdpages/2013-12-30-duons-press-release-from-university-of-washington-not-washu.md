title: "Duons Press Release from University of Washington, not WashU"
---

Thanks to those that pointed out my mix-up between WashU and the University of Washington in the [post about the duons press release](http://www.checkmatescientist.net/2013/12/washu-dna-duons-press-release.html). The text has been corrected.

Apologies to all.
