> <div style="text-align: left;">Just last week I was on a call with a potential investor when he mentioned a colleague whose startup was in "stealth mode." Which instantly reminded me of one of my favourite quotes. It came from Howard Aiken, anearly pioneer of computing: "Don't worry about people stealing an idea. If it's original, you will have to ram it down their throats."</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">Though the article was directed towards CEOs of start up companies, the advice is relevant for anyone conducting a scientific research project. 'Collaboration' has been a buzzword for as long as I can remember, which in research usually doesn't directly translate into 'teamwork', as green researchers are apt to believe. Rather good 'collaborative' efforts means situations with 'multiple complementary people working towards a common goal'.</div><div style="text-align: left;">To make these take off, scientists should <strike>steal</strike> adopt strategies that sometimes become mantra among businessfolk. Get in the mindset that the project in your care is a small startup and don't fall into these stealth mode traps mentioned on Techvibes:</div><ol><li>Nobody wants to steal your idea.</li><li>Most people will never even hear of your startup.</li><li>You leave stones unturned.</li><li>Opportunity often takes a long time to knock.</li><li>Get honest feedback when you can use it.</li></ol><div style="text-align: left;">[Link](http://www.techvibes.com/blog/why-stealth-mode-will-kill-your-startup-2013-01-02) to original article</div>
