title: "Two Linked Drugs Are Better Than One"
---

The MIT Technology Review has a short article describing a new strategy for double dosing multiple drugs; [linking them together](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/513896/multifunctional-drugs-may-offer-better-than-additive-effects/): 

> Catabasis has found a way around the challenge of identifying a single  active molecule that can hit multiple pathways effectively: using a  chemical linker to bring together two active molecules. The synergistic  effect of the linked molecules may arise from the fact that the two  compounds both “get to the right place at the right time.”

The company, [Catabasis Pharmaceuticals](http://www.catabasis.com/index.php), is developing [a technology](http://www.catabasis.com/scitech.php) that can combine two compounds together using a linker that supposedly puts the drugs into an inactive form in the bloodstream, but which is cut within cells when the whole package is absorbed.
