title: "Two Arguments Regarding Canada's Research Tax Credits"
---

Should government spend to stimulate invention in businesses?

John Lester, from The School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary, argues in the <em>National Post</em> that research and development tax credits for small businesses should be reduced or eliminated, because subsidies for these businesses don't stimulate much marginal R&amp;D spending:


> The problem is not only that the case for providing additional support  for small firms is weak, but also that the cost of providing assistance  rises along with the subsidy rate. Since firms receive a subsidy on all the R&amp;D they undertake, not  just on the additional R&amp;D resulting from the subsidy, the “bang for  the buck” (the increase in R&amp;D per dollar of subsidy) falls as the  subsidy rate rises.

Where 'the cost' is the cost of the subsidy to the government.
He continues:
 
Based on these results, the prudent policy approach would be to scale  back the amount of support provided to small business. The enhanced  SR&amp;ED credit should be reduced in line with the regular credit and  additional support should be focused on innovative startups delivered  through spending programs such as [IRAP](http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/irap/index.html). 

This article triggered a response from Ron Freedman of Research Infosource, who thins Lester's argument is chock full of holes:
<em> </em>
<em> </em>

> What he doesn’t appreciate is that a small company with revenues of  $1-million and a profit of 5% ($50,000) can afford to do little research  on its own. A large company with revenues of $10-million and a profit  of $500,000 can afford a sizeable R&amp;D program. Thus, (the lack of)  economies of scale are an important rationale for supporting small  technology-based companies, if we want to grow them into larger firms.


> <em></em>Strangely, Mr. Lester argues that the rationale for government support  for industrial research is small firms’ “financing difficulties” — the  fact that they may not be able to raise external funds to support  R&amp;D. ... In any event the real issue for small firms is not, as Mr. Lester  claims, raising external funds for research (try that one on Dragon’s  Den), but funding research from internal cash flow.

However, the arguments over whether it's better for small or large businesses qualify for government support can be set aside for one major feature of Canada's SR&amp;ED program: [non-Canadian companies can use Canadian government funds to support their research and development](http://investincanada.gc.ca/eng/publications/rd-tax-credit-fact-sheet.aspx), with a very valuable feature:

> The Canadian subsidiary can carry out qualifying SR&amp;ED activities  in Canada and, through deducting the expenditures and claiming the 20%  tax credit, the subsidiary can significantly reduce or even eliminate  Canadian taxes payable.
 The foreign parent can contract the Canadian subsidiary to carry out  the SR&amp;ED activities on their behalf, in which case the foreign  parent will own the rights to the SR&amp;ED, and the Canadian subsidiary  can still make use of the SR&amp;ED tax incentive program.

You're reading that correctly. A foreign company can receive a subsidy to conduct R&amp;D, yet still be able to make full use of the intellectual property developed in Canada.

I assume that this feature exists to keep Canadian science and technology jobs from moving elsewhere, but the real purpose of a government support system for R&amp;D should be to ensure that inventions with really big returns happen in Canada and that the benefits accrue to the funders of that research.
