title: "Wikipedia Article Views Predict Stock Market Falls"
---

Here's a very simple, yet intriguing, study on [the relationship between Wikipedia page views and stock market returns](http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130508/srep01801/full/srep01801.html):

> In our analysis, we find evidence of increases in the number of page  views of articles relating to companies or other financial topics before  stock market falls.

and 

> We propose one potential explanation in line with these results. We first suggest that *Wikipedia* records may provide a proxy measurement of the information gathering  process of a subset of investors for the investigated period. We further  note that previous studies in behavioural economics have demonstrated  that humans are loss averse:  that is, they are more concerned about losing £5 than they are about  missing an opportunity to gain £5. By this logic, it could be argued  that the trading decision of greatest consequence for a trader would be  to sell a stock at a lower price than they had previously believed it  was worth. If we assume that investors may be willing to invest more  efforts in information gathering before making a decision which they  view to be of greater consequence, then it would follow that increases  in information gathering would precede falls in stock market prices, in  line with our results.

The work was led by [Tobias Preis](http://www.tobiaspreis.de/), who has a ton of awesome content and research presentations if finance is your area of interest (his website is a little outdated).

My only question is 'Where's the website for this work?'
