title: "A Peek Inside The New Hospital for Sick Children's Research Tower"
---

Tom Blackwell, National Post, reports on the soon-to-be open Peter Gilgan Center for Research and Learning tower, informally known as "[the Sick Kids' Research Building](http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/08/26/na0827-tb-sickkids/)":

> Scientists have traditionally toiled in small, self-contained labs,  mixing mainly with those in the same narrow discipline and doing much of  their communication via the Internet,said Janet Rossant, Sick Kids’  chief of research. 


> That fractured culture is not helped at the Toronto hospital, a major  research centre as well as one of the country’s foremost hospitals for  children, by having scientists divided among six buildings. All 2,000 research staff will be moving into the new, 21-storey Peter Gilgan tower next month.

It's a nice space (I especially like <a href="http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2013/08/sick-kids-atrium.jpg?w=620&amp;h=465" target="_blank">the atrium</a>), and one which looks like it'll promote teamwork and communication. The article closes with this bit of sane advice from a scientist:

> Ms. Josselyn, a neurophysiologist, said she believes other workplaces  can benefit from the human interaction that brought the two scientists  together. “I think it’s always hugely important,” she said. 


> “If you encounter some problems or you just want to bounce an idea of  somebody, it’s so much easier if you already have a connection with  them … I think non-work-related interacting with colleagues always  promotes work.”
