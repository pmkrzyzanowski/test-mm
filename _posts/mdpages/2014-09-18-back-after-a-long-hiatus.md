title: "Back After A Long Hiatus"
---

It's been a long while since I last posted, and there's a good reason why. I'm currently putting together a post to describe the additional project that I've taken up, which required a lot of time away from blogging in order to tie up loose ends, prepare, not to mention take a decent vacation beforehand.

So in short, I expect to be contributing posts more regularly going forward. The easiest ways to follow for new content are still [@CheckmateSci](https://twitter.com/CheckmateSci) and via [RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheCheckmateScientist).

Cheers,
Paul
