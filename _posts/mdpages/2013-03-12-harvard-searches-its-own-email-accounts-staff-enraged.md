title: "Harvard Searches It's Own Email Accounts, Staff Enraged"
---

There's a nice commentary on [Harvard searching staff emails](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/education/harvard-search-e-mail-accounts.html) at the New York Times:

> Faculty responses revealed a gap between expectations in academia, where  privacy is often seen as integral to academic freedom, and the  corporate world, in which employees are often told to assume that  workplace e-mails are not private. Some professors wondered aloud  whether they had been naïve to think that things would be different at a  university, and said they were forced to re-examine assumptions about  confidentiality.

The article does explain that Harvard searched resident dean accounts, which are arguably work related, and even then only searched subject headings for evidence that a particular email was forwarded. If the @harvard.edu account is a work related account, the content belongs to Harvard.

This is a life lesson for all learned people with university accounts: Unless the email account has explicitly been made for your personal use, it's probably a workplace e-mail.
