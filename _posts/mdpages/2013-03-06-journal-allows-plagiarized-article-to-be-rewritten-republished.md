[An interesting case of academic plagiarism](http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/you-plagiarized-no-problem-says-journal-well-retract-so-you-can-rewrite-and-well-republish/) described at Retraction Watch:

> A reader flagged the plagiarism in the original paper, “Protein  domains, catalytic activity, and subcellular distribution of mouse  NTE-related esterase,” by Ping’an Chang and colleagues, which led the  research team to revise and resubmit the manuscript.

With an interesting comment from reader scott allen:

> Universities have lawyers on staff, who should be more active in this  area, granting agencies should be more proactive in the recovery monies,  why shouldn’t universities, professors be required to return the grant  money. Any honest researcher who didn’t get a grant that was given to  one of these fraudsters should be mad as heck.

Maybe not mad as heck, but pretty damn annoyed that the research system isn't more efficient at rooting these people out.
