title: "How do you find cancer cells?  Predictions for the very near future"
---

Many of my friends and family have asked me about cancer research, mostly because that's the thirty second explanation of what I do. Our conversations usually begin with "<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/cancerlibrary/what-is-cancer">What is cancer?</a>" but end up discussing how to test for cancer, how to kill cancer cells, or how certain drugs are prescribed (or not) to cancer patients, depending on what kind of cancer they have.

One area of research that's extremely interesting is how diagnostic tests for cancer are being developed. Winny Tan over at Genetic Engineering News published a few big [predictions for the future of cancer testing](http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/bold-predictions-for-future-cancer-tests/4405/), most of which I don't think are as futuristic as many people like to believe. This is a great thing.

The basic technology for many genetic tests already exists and it's (just) a matter of developing the right tests for the right cancer, though this last part is easier said than done.

<b>Trend #1: Multiplexing cancer biomarker tests</b>

GEN says:

> We are already seeing potential cases for this,  including Bio-Referenceâ€™s Onkomatch test that matches effective  therapeutic agents (either currently marketed or in a clinical trial) to  the tumor molecular profile of lung cancer patients. The Onkomatch test  evaluates 68 key mutations including EGFR, BRAF, and KRAS at a list  price of $995.

This medium level of gene chip based multiplexed tests is making way for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) based tests that will provide information about hundreds or thousands of potential mutations in a single tumour sample, at a comparable cost. The best feature of an NGS based test is that it's much more precise than a stain based test conducted by a pathologist.

<b>Trend #2: Centralization of testing and test coming from large teams</b>


> Large multicenter research efforts such as those involving designated  NCI centers provide advantages in specimen and resource pooling. Furthermore, the high quality of the clinical research and  collaboration will likely translate into clinically valuable and  well-validated tests.

This sounds very team-based but frankly it's the only viable direction to go.

Most well known cancer tests represent low hanging fruit that in retrospect, looks obvious. However, the days of finding the "one gene" responsible for cancer, or most cases of a specific type of cancer are over. We're not even entering - we are in the thicket of - a stage where more and more cancer causing mutations are present at low frequencies of patients. For example, the TCGA consortium has identified mutants a low, sub 5% frequencies.
 
<b>Trend #3: Cancer will become a "chronic disease"</b>

The predictions for this part are very ambitious, as it depends on being able to detect and target dynamically evolving cancer cells. I'm not sure of the market opportunity for passive monitoring of how cancer cells are changing without being able to also kill them or at least limit their ability to multiply.

Tan also mentions circulating tumour cells as a possible easy route to biopsies,
