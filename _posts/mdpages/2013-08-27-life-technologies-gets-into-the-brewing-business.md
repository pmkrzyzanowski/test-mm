> Life Technologies Corporation today announced the  expansion of its food safety portfolio by partnering with PIKA  Weihenstephan to provide molecular testing solutions for the detection  of spoilage organisms in the brewing and beverage market. Life  Technologies is now the only supplier to provide both enrichment media  and PCR kits designed to suit the changing needs and challenges in  beverage quality and safety.

And in doing so, Life helps address a huge problem:

> For generations, brewers have been looking for ways to eliminate beer  spoilage bacteria, which can impact the smell, taste and clarity of the  end product. By partnering with PIKA Weihenstephan, Life Technologies  will offer, not only the testing solutions, but also the consultancy  services for brewers to understand and respond to positive test results.
