title: "Don't Be a Hero"
---

Christopher Fasano [describes](http://www.stemcultures.com/dont-be-a-hero-be-a-scientist-lets-all-work-together-towards-one-common-cause/) how his lab is great at growing neural stem cells but not very good at genomics and bioinformatics:

> I can surely learn this process and try to integrate it into my lab. But  that would be heroic, and as you know, I am not a hero. So what do we  do? We collaborate with bioinformaticists and mathematicians who do this  for a living, and we all come together to move the project along.

Everyone starts out having that urge to "be a hero" and save the day, however small. Some people learn to control it early and some people go on trying to be a hero in various circumstances for years.

Doing a few years of research teaches people to be more collaborative as a natural by-product of dealing with the unknown. It has a relentless ability to bring down people trying to throw wild pitches and make complicated experiments work.

Of course, if the results are great the student/postdoc/scientist looks brilliant and becomes the hero of the day. But remember that these heroic stories come at the cost of hundreds of failures that bulk up a dusty lab notebook somewhere.
