title: "The Natural Breakup of Geron Discussed at Signals Blog"
---

An article I wrote discussing [BioTime's recent purchase of Geron's stem cell program](http://www.signalsblog.ca/biotime-a-new-geron-without-a-decade-of-baggage/) was just published on [Signals Blog](http://www.signalsblog.ca/).

The transaction was very obvious once you consider all the executives involved. Two former Geron executives, Michael West and Tom Okarma, have been involved in stem cell research for decades and lead the companies acquiring the research program. Geron becomes a company commercializing a portfolio of oncology drugs with leadership to match the needs of those ambitions.
