Andy Coghlan, at New Scientist:

Very cool! One of the discoverers, [Nathan Magarvey](http://iidr.mcmaster.ca/investigators/nathan-magarvey.html), of McMaster University in Canada thinks that the protein responsible could be used to create sensors capable of detecting gold ions in groundwater. It wouldn't exactly extract much gold but it could provide an inexpensive method of prospecting by taking water samples.
