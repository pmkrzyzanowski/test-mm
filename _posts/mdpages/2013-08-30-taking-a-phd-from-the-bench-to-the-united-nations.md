[Marga Gual Soler](https://twitter.com/margagual) shares [her career trajectory](http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2013_08_21/caredit.a1300178) at Science Careers:

> In February, I joined the [NGO Branch of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs](http://esango.un.org/paperless/Web) for a 6-month internship exploring how science, technology, and  innovation can drive sustainable development. ... 


> It has been fascinating to discover how science can benefit society  at multiple levels: by informing the sustainable development agenda,  improving access to education and healthcare, and fostering  technological cooperation among countries. I also came to realize that  very few people know that [access to scientific advancement and its benefits is recognized as a universal human right](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6138/1291.full).

Marga's story is a great example of how almost every 'extra-curricular' activity during graduate school can help develop skills for a future career. Don't let anyone convince you that the only things that should be done during graduate school are reading, research, and writing; those people don't have your best interests in mind.

If you have a passion to do something unusual or atypical when you're not working - do it! [Taking breaks from your main projects](http://www.checkmatescientist.net/2013/04/remembering-to-forget.html) paradoxically increases your productivity.
