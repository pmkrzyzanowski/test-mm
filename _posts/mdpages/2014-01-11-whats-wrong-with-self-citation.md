title: "What's Wrong with Self-Citation?"
---

At Nature, Elissa Cameron, Amy Edwards, and Angela White [make a good point](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v505/n7482/full/505160b.html):

> It would ... be useful to halt the inclusion of author self-citations  in measures of research impact. ... After all, genuine impact hinges on independent citation.

From one aspect they're right; at the most superficial level a self-citation can be a lame attempt to add another tick on your own paper's impact factor without any regard for the connection between the content of your two papers.

But the reality is that self-citations are more complicated than that.

In the middle of the quote above, the authors drop this small tidbit: 

> Self-citation is a male-biased  practice ([](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534712002753)). ([Elissa Z. Cameron, Amy M. Edwards, Angela M. White, ](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v505/n7482/full/505160b.html))

The obvious self-citation here was caught by Nature reader Tani Davis, who commented:

> Strange how the authors support one of their two points (an alleged male bias in self-citation) by self-citation, and that reference doesn't actually support the point. All I can see there is a weak reference to another paper "and perhaps moderate sexual dimorphism in self-citation rates [10]". That reference in turn merely states (at least in the abstract) that "Self-citation correlates weakly with the gender of the citing author".

That paper ([found here](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10816-006-9001-5/fulltext.html)) s

Self-citation rates range from less than 2% in art history to 17% in  neurobiology. In general, humanities have the lowest rates of  self-citation while physical sciences have the highest (Snyder and  Bonzi, <cite>[1998](http://link.springer.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/10.1007%2Fs10816-006-9001-5/fulltext.html#CR39)</cite>;
