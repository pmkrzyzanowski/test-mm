The folks at MaRS just released this little video highlighting [five tips for doing business in Silicon Valley](http://www.marsdd.com/news-and-insights/five-tips-business-silicon-valley/). The advice is applicable anywhere.

> 1. To succeed, first understand the areaâ€™s history.

Whenever you're working with people outside of your area, be it geographical or outside of your area of expertise, you need to be able to relate to where they came from. How do their values differ from yours? What is important to them? Is there something about that location or field that attracts certain type of people, or encourages a particular kind of behaviour (think entrepreneurship, research excellence, etc.)?
