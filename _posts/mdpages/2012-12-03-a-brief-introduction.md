title: "A brief introduction"

After spending several years writing articles and reports in the scientific arena, not to mention ghost-writing bits and pieces of many academic articles and grant applications, I thought it would be good to start collecting and sharing the observations and insights that I encounter on a day-to-day basis.

I hope that you'll enjoy the posts that emerge in the future.
