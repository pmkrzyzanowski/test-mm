If you've ever wondered what the rhythm of the seasons looks like from space, [here's your chance](http://elitedaily.com/news/world/amazing-gif-shows-how-the-earth-transforms-over-the-course-of-one-year/).

> Michigan programmer John Nelson created an absolutely mesmerizing  animated video designed to provide a view of our planet “breathing” over  the course of one year.
The foundation of the video is pictures from NASA’s “Blue Marble Next  Generation” project, which takes a picture of the Earth each month.

The effect is just plain aweseome. In his words:

> “I can track one location throughout a year to compare the annual push  and pull of snow and plant life there, while in my periphery I see the  oscillating wave of life advancing and retreating, advancing and  retreating. And I’m reassured by it.”

Just another great example of presentation style taking relatively simple data and taking it to the next level.
