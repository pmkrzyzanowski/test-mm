title: "Signals Blog Awarded 2nd Place Canadian B2B Blog"
---

Congratulations to [Signals Blog](http://www.signalsblog.ca/), which recently was [awarded second place](http://www.canadianonlinepublishingawards.com/2013/winners.php) in the business-to-business blog category in the recent Canadian Online Publishing Awards competition!

The COPAs consider brands from a lot of other media publishing companies - Rogers Media, Huffington Post Canada, Corus Entertainment, the Toronto Star, and Metro News, to name a few - so for the Stem Cell Network to be recognized for the quality Signals has achieved is a great achievement!

I've had the pleasure of working with Lisa Willemse, the Director of Communications responsible for Signals for the past few years, who had [the following to say](http://www.signalsblog.ca/science-bloggers-this-awards-for-you/) about the win:

> I’m immensely proud of this blog, but perhaps not for the reason you  might think. Yes, it’s nice to win awards and be recognized. Yes, I’m  happy this blog has contributed to important, ongoing discussions about  stem cell and regenerative medicine research and has helped share  knowledge with broader audiences. But I get the best warm fuzzy from the  success of our bloggers.

So once again, congrats!
