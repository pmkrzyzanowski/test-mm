title: "Genomic Sequencing Companies Continue To Evolve"
---

There's [a nice, short review](http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v12/n5/full/nrd4006.html) of the evolving genome sequencing market in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery:

> Historically, manufacturers have relied on selling sequencing  technologies and reagents. Today, Illumina and other leading companies  operate complex business models that encompass the manufacture of genomic sequencing technologies, the provision of commercial genomic sequencing services and the sale of  products in the informatics and diagnostics markets.

I recently mentioned that sequencing companies are positioning themselves to become [the backbone of the medical system](http://www.checkmatescientist.net/2013/04/sequencing-companies-infrastructure-of.html), as it's the kind of technology that's suited to having a single point of contact if genomic information is needed from a wide range of samples.

I'm starting to think the trend isn't even limited to human health or research uses; Jay Flatley, Illumina's CEO quipped on a recent earnings call that "ultimately, ... you're  going to be doing genotyping on every cow that's born and using that as  a way to triage its future". Over [30 million calves](http://www.beefusa.org/beefindustrystatistics.aspx) make that another huge application that isn't mired in the safety issues relevant to humans.

Returning to the Nature Review, it's important to keep several obstacles in mind that are still blocking genomic technologies from widespread use, in addition to the analysis bottleneck of being able to analyze all the data, which is the province of computational biologists like myself:

> Despite the rapid progress in the development of sequencing strategies,  the era of personalized medicine is still a distant goal. Several  challenges remain, including the inadequate training of physicians in  the area of personalized medicine, attaining the <span class="mb">$</span>1,000  genome, enhanced pharmaceutical R&amp;D processes to leverage genomic  advances and an international framework for regulating the use of  genomic data in the clinic and thereby protecting patient privacy.
