A post at [Trade Secrets](http://blogs.nature.com/tradesecrets/) discusses [the needs of a bioscience ecosystem](http://blogs.nature.com/tradesecrets/2012/06/13/minimum-requirement-for-a-successful-bioscience-ecosystem):

In most business case examples, a lot of attention is placed on having the right product and a company with the right people, with enough money to run towards the next milestone/exit point. [This blog post](http://blogs.nature.com/tradesecrets/2012/06/13/minimum-requirement-for-a-successful-bioscience-ecosystem) walks through Singapore's experience over the past thirty years as an example,

> The reasons for Singapore’s incredible success is the subject of heated  debate, but two factors stand out – its proximity to large and growing  markets (China, S. Korea, etc), and its early development of a  government-backed bioscience ecosystem to support companies including  services, manufactures and, critically, cash.

In an ecosystem, three factors are important: “food”, “fuel”, and  “space”. In economic terms, "food" is described as a supply of innovation; “fuel” is access to entrepreneurial energy and a constant supply of investment  cash; and “space” is a  supportive political and economic environment.

The catch is that despite having these three factors in ample supply, biosciences economy will hit soon hit a ceiling without an extra nudge:

> To  develop and sustain a high-growth, scalable, bioscience economy there  must also be a reliable and economical route to global markets. This is a  vital component that requires innovation in terms of business models  and in terms of applying government assistance to reach external  markets.

Seems reasonable for the most part. Local markets for biotechnology products don't exist, except when solving [regional problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice).
