title: "Neurocrine Biosciences: Developing a Drug With a Huge Market"
---

This morning, Neurocrine Biosciences shot up 79% [on news](http://www.4-traders.com/NEUROCRINE-BIOSCIENCES-I-10163/news/Neurocrine-Biosciences-Inc--Ahead-of-the-Bell-Neurocrine-shares-keep-climbing-17759527/) that a study of their small molecule NBI-98854 to treat tardive dyskinesia (a disorder characterized by [involuntary facial movements](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000685.htm)) is progressing well. The drug <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=68817&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;highlight=&amp;ID=1888278" target="_blank">targets and inhibits VMAT2</a>, a [solute carrier channel](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6571) that transports monoamines at nerve synaptic junctions, including <span class="ccbnTxt">dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine.</span>

<span class="ccbnTxt">Though tardive dyskinesia (TD) at first sounds similar to the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, apparently they're very different, [according to the Tardive Dyskinesia Center](http://www.tardivedyskinesia.com/common-associations/parkinsons-disease.php), which explains why the company isn't angling NBI-98854 as a possible drug for use in Parkinson's.</span>

<span class="ccbnTxt">Nevertheless, I don't think Parkinson's would have been the major market for Neurocrine's drug. What makes NBI-98854 interesting is that the long term use of a variety of *other* drugs used to treat common conditions can lead to TD; take </span><span class="ccbnTxt">[metclopramide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metoclopramide) (Reglan) for treatment of </span><span class="ccbnTxt"><span class="ccbnTxt"></span><span class="ccbnTxt"><span class="ccbnTxt">nausea and vomiting, or </span></span>espesically <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682180.html" target="_blank">Haloperidol (Haldol)</a> as an example of many </span><span class="ccbnTxt"><span class="ccbnTxt">anti-psychotic drugs</span>. Here's [a laundry list](http://www.dystonia-foundation.org/pages/more_info/76.php) of about twenty drugs that can lead to TD (From </span><span class="ccbnTxt">The Dystonia Foundation). </span>

<span class="ccbnTxt">So while it still may be early to say Neurocrine is in the clear, it seems that with NBI-98854 the company is positioning itself to own a companion drug that'll be used in a wide variety of markets. A very nice strategy indeed.</span>
