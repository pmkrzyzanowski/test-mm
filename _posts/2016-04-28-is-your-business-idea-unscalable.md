title: "Is your business idea unscalable?"

[Jon Westenberg](https://medium.com/life-learning/you-don-t-have-to-build-a-scalable-startup-fd1e7361cdad#.d2zz0yb4e):

> There’s a lot of pressure put on young entrepreneurs. It’s the pressure to only build scalable startups, rather than focusing their efforts on any other type of business. You can see this almost everywhere. If you’re not building high growth software or platforms, you’re seen as wasting your time. 

It’s snobbish. And it’s dangerous. It relies on the idea that there are businesses that are inherently better than others. And they’re only the businesses that have room to become $100,000,000 companies.

Lots of business ideas aren't scalable, but they can still make a ton of money for the founders.
